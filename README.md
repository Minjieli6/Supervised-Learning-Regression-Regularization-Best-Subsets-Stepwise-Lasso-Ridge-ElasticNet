# Goal

1. Apply stepwise regression techniques for model selection using various metrics
2. Build and evaluate lasso, ridge, and ElasticNet regularization models


# Data
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

# Steps
1. cross-validation
2. EDA
3. Transform and feature engineer as appropriate
4. Build regression models, stepwise, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet
5. Conduct hyperparameter tuning for the ElasticNet.
6. Evaluate model performance
